# Linux
There are two clipboards:
### PRIMARY
Highlighted text would be put into a buffer called the PRIMARY selection. Some applications but not all allow you to paste PRIMARY selections by using the middle-mouse or Shift+Insert.  
In summary, there are several ways to select text with the left mouse button:
- clik-and-drag to highlight and select text
- doble-clicking to select a word
- tripple-clicking to select a line

Another way to copy text that can be more than one full screen:
- left click at the start of the intended selection
- right click at the end of the selection

### CLIPBOARD
- Copy: Ctrl+c
- Cut: Ctrl+x
- Paste:
    - Ctrl+v (It keeps the formatting from original text)
    - Ctrl+Shift+v (It strips all the formatting)

# macOS
There is only one clipboard:
### CLIPBOARD
- Copy: Command+c
- Cut: Command+x
- Paste:
    - Command+v (It keeps the formatting from original text)
    - Command+Shift+v (It strips all the formatting)

# Additional Information
In vim or tmux, Ctrl(Command)+Shift+v should be used to copy text because the keybinding of the Ctrl(Command)+v is already used.
